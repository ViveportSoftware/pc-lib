Welcome to our project! When committing code, please keep in mind the following important instructions:

## Use `pnpm commit` for code commits

For better commit messages, please use `pnpm commit` instead of `git commit`. This will guide you through a series of prompts to help you write a better commit message.

```bash
pnpm commit
```
